## DevOps

I learned that Git is a version control tool that tracks changes over time so you can safely edit and undo work. 
I practiced staging and committing so each saved change has a clear message and history. 
I learned how GitHub hosts repositories online so code can be backed up and shared.
I also understood how pushing sends my local commits to GitHub, while pulling brings remote changes down.
Using commit history helped me see progress and troubleshoot mistakes. Overall, Git and GitHub make it easier to work on projects alone or with a team without losing work.
